📘 README: Medical Insurance Cost Prediction Using Machine Learning
🧠 Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning model that predicts medical insurance charges based on key demographic and lifestyle factors, including:

Age

Sex

Body Mass Index (BMI)

Smoking habits

Geographical region

Previous insurance charges

The model was built and trained using Google Colab, with an emphasis on clean data processing, exploratory data analysis, and model optimisation. The goal of this project is to understand how different variables influence insurance pricing and to demonstrate practical machine learning implementation skills.

📊 Dataset

The project uses the widely known Medical Insurance Dataset, which contains information on over 1,300 individuals.
Key variables include:
| Variable   | Description                                              |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `age`      | Age of the individual                                    |
| `sex`      | Male / Female                                            |
| `bmi`      | Body Mass Index                                          |
| `children` | Number of dependents                                     |
| `smoker`   | Yes / No                                                 |
| `region`   | U.S. region (southwest, southeast, northwest, northeast) |
| `charges`  | Medical insurance cost                                   |
